Traffic Portal - Using
**********************
Traffic Portal is the official Traffic Control UI. Traffic Portal typically runs on a different machine than Traffic Ops, and works by using the Traffic Ops API. The following high-level items are available in the Traffic Portal menu.

.. figure:: ./images/tp_menu.png

	:alt: The Traffic Portal Landing Page

	Traffic Portal Start Page

Dashboard
=========
The Dashboard is the default landing page for Traffic Portal. It provides a real-time view into the main performance indicators of the CDNs managed by Traffic Control. It also displays various statistics about the overall health of your CDN.

Current Bandwidth
	The current bandwidth of all of your CDNs.

Current Connections
	The current number of connections to all of your CDNs.

Healthy Caches
	Displays the number of healthy caches across all CDNs. Click the link to view the healthy caches on the cache stats page.

Unhealthy Caches
	Displays the number of unhealthy caches across all CDNs. Click the link to view the unhealthy caches on the cache stats page.

Online Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache server` s with ONLINE status. Traffic Monitor will not monitor the state of ONLINE servers [1]_.

Reported Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache server` s with REPORTED status [1]_.

Offline Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache server` s with OFFLINE status [1]_.

Admin Down Caches
	Displays the number of caches with ADMIN_DOWN status [1]_.

Each component of this view is updated on the intervals defined in the :file:`traffic_portal_properties.json` configuration file.

.. [1] For more information, see :ref:`health-proto`.

CDNs
====
A table of CDNs with the following columns:

:Name:           The name of the CDN
:Domain:         The CDN's Top-Level Domain (TLD)
:DNSSEC Enabled: 'true' if :ref:`tr-dnssec` is enabled on this CDN, 'false' otherwise.

CDN management includes the ability to (where applicable):

- diff CDN snapshots
- create a CDN snapshot
- manage a CDN's DNSSEC keys
- manage a CDN's federations
- view :term:`Delivery Service`\ s of a CDN
- view CDN profiles
- view servers within a CDN

Monitor
=======
The :guilabel:`Monitor` section of Traffic Portal is used to display statistics regarding the various :term:`cache server` s within all CDNs visible to the user. It retrieves this information through the Traffic Ops API from Traffic Monitor instances.

	:align: center
	:alt: The 'Tools' Menu

	The 'Tools' Menu

Invalidate Content
------------------
Here, specific assets can be invalidated in all caches of a :term:`Delivery Service`, forcing content to be updated from the origin. Specifically, this *doesn't* mean that :term:`cache server` s will immediately remove items from their caches, but rather will fetch new copies whenever a request is made matching the 'Asset URL' regular expression. This behavior persists until the Invalidate Content Job's :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` expires. Each entry in the table on this page has the following fields:

:term:`Delivery Service`: The :term:`Delivery Service` to which to apply this Invalidate Content Job
:Asset URL:        A URL or regular expression which describes the asset(s) to be invalidated
:Parameters:       So far, the only use for this is setting a :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` over which the Invalidate Content Job shall remain active
:Start:            An effective start time until which the job is delayed
:Created By:       The user name of the person who created this Invalidate Content Job

Invalidate content includes the ability to (where applicable):

- create a new invalidate content job

Generate ISO
------------
Generates a boot-able system image for any of the servers in the Servers table (or any server for that matter). Currently it only supports CentOS 7, but if you're brave and pure of heart you MIGHT be able to get it to work with other Unix-like Operating Systems. The interface is *mostly* self-explanatory, but here is a short explanation of the fields in that form.

Copy Server Attributes From
	Optional. This option lets the user choose a server from the Traffic Ops database and will auto-fill the other fields as much as possible based on that server's properties
OS Version
	This list is populated by modifying the :file:`osversions.cfg` file on the Traffic Ops server. This file maps OS names to the name of a directory under ``app/public/iso/`` directory within the Traffic Ops install directory
Hostname
	The desired hostname of the resultant system
Domain
	The desired domain name of the resultant system
DHCP
	If this is 'no' the IP settings of the system must be specified, and the following extra fields will appear:

		IP Address
			The resultant system's IPv4 Address
		Network Subnet
			The system's network subnet mask
		Network Gateway
			The system's network gateway's IPv4 Address

Network MTU
	The system's network's :abbr:`MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)`. Despite being a text field, this can only be 1500 or 9000 - it should almost always be 1500

		.. seealso:: `The Maximum transmission unit Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit>`_

Disk for OS Install
	The disk on which to install the base system. A reasonable default is ``sda`` (the ``/dev/`` prefix is not necessary)
Root Password
	The password to be used for the root user. Input is MD5 hashed before being written to disk
Confirm Root Password
	Repeat the 'Root Password' to be sure it's right
Interface Name
	Optional. The name of the resultant system's network interface. Typical values are ``bond0``, ``eth4``, etc. If ``bond0`` is entered, a Link Aggregation Control Protocol bonding configuration will be written

		.. seealso:: `The Link aggregation Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation>`_

Stream ISO
	If this is 'yes', then the download will start immediately as the ISO is written directly to the socket connection to Traffic Ops. If this is 'no', then the download will begin only *after* the ISO has finished being generated. For almost all use cases, this should be 'yes'.

User Admin
==========
This section offers administrative functionality for users and their permissions.
