.. _to-api-users-register:

******************
``users/register``
******************

``POST``
========
Register a user and send registration email.

:Auth. Required: Yes
:Roles Required: "admin" or "operations"
:Response Type:  ``undefined``

Request Structure
-----------------
:email: Email address of the new user

	.. versionchanged:: 1.4
		Prior to version 1.4, the email was validated using the `Email::Valid Perl package <https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Valid>`_ but is now validated (circuitously) by `GitHub user asaskevich's regular expression <https://github.com/asaskevich/govalidator/blob/9a090521c4893a35ca9a228628abf8ba93f63108/patterns.go#L7>`_ . Note that neither method can actually distinguish a valid, deliverable, email address but merely ensure the email is in a commonly-found format.

:role:     The integral, unique identifier of the highest permissions role which will be afforded to the new user
:tenantId: An optional field containing the integral, unique identifier of the tenant to which the new user will belong

	.. note:: This field is optional if and only if tenancy is not enabled in Traffic Ops.
