	+======+========================================================================+
	| name | The name of the CDN for which monitoring configuration will be fetched |
	+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Response Structure
------------------
:cacheGroups: An array of objects representing each of the Cache Groups being monitored within this CDN

	:coordinates: An object representing the physical location of this Cache Group

		:latitude:  The geographic latitude of this Cache Group
		:longitude: The geographic longitude of this Cache Group

	:name: The name of this Cache Group

:config: A collection of parameters used to configure the monitoring behaviour of Traffic Monitor

	:hack.ttl:                    Unknown
	:health.event-count:          The total number of health events to store
	:health.polling.interval:     An interval in milliseconds on which to poll for health statistics
	:health.threadPool:           The number of threads to be used for health polling
	:health.timepad:              A 'padding time' to add to requests to spread them out for Traffic Control systems that use a large number of Traffic Monitors
	:tm.crConfig.polling.url:     The URL from which a CRConfig can be obtained
	:tm.dataServer.polling.url:   The URL from which a list of data servers can be obtained
	:tm.healthParams.polling.url: The URL from which a list of health-polling parameters can be obtained
	:tm.polling.interval:         The interval at which to poll for configuration updates

:deliveryServices: An array of objects representing each :term:`Delivery Service` provided by this CDN

	:status:             The :term:`Delivery Service`'s status
	:totalKbpsThreshold: A threshold rate of data transfer this :term:`Delivery Service` is configured to handle, in Kilobits per second
	:totalTpsThreshold:  A threshold amount of transactions per second that this :term:`Delivery Service` is configured to handle
	:xmlId:              An integral, unique identifier for this Deliver Service (named "xmlId" for legacy reasons)

:profiles: An array of the profiles in use by the :term:`cache server` s and :term:`Delivery Service`\ s belonging to this CDN

	:name:       The profile's name
	:parameters: An array of the parameters in this profile that relate to monitoring configuration. This can be ``null`` if the servers using this profile cannot be monitored (e.g. Traffic Routers)

		:health.connection.timeout:                 A timeout value, in milliseconds, to wait before giving up on a health check request
		:health.polling.url:                        A URL to request for polling health. Substitutions can be made in a shell-like syntax using the properties of an object from the ``"trafficServers"`` array
		:health.threshold.availableBandwidthInKbps: The total amount of bandwidth that servers using this profile are allowed, in Kilobits per second. This is a string and using comparison operators to specify ranges, e.g. ">10" means "more than 10 kbps"
		:health.threshold.loadavg:                  The UNIX loadavg at which the server should be marked "unhealthy" - see ``man uptime``
		:health.threshold.queryTime:                The highest allowed length of time for completing health queries (after connection has been established) in milliseconds
		:history.count:                             The number of past events to store; once this number is reached, the oldest event will be forgotten before a new one can be added

	:type: The type of the profile

:trafficMonitors: An array of objects representing each Traffic Monitor that monitors this CDN (this is used by Traffic Monitor's "peer polling" function)

	:fqdn:     AN FQDN that resolves to the IP (and/or IPv6) address of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance
	:hostname: The hostname of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance
	:ip6:      The IPv6 address of this Traffic Monitor - when applicable
	:ip:       The IP address of this Traffic Monitor
	:port:     The port on which this Traffic Monitor listens for incoming connections
	:profile:  The name of the profile assigned to this Traffic Monitor
	:status:   The status of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance

:trafficServers: An array of objects that represent the caches being monitored within this CDN

	:cacheGroup:    The Cache Group to which this cache belongs
	:fqdn:          A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that resolves to the :term:`cache server`'s IP (or IPv6) address
	:hashId:        The short name for the :term:`cache server` - named "hashId" for legacy reasons
	:hostName:      The (short) hostname of the :term:`cache server`
	:interfacename: The name of the network interface device being used by the cache's HTTP proxy
	:ip6:           The cache's IPv6 address - when applicable
	:ip:            The cache's IP address
	:port:          The port on which the cache listens for incoming connections
	:profile:       The name of the profile assigned to this cache
	:status:        The status of the Cache
	:type:          The type of the cache - should be either ``EDGE`` or ``MID``
