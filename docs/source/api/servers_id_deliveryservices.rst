	2
		Only route when the client's IP is found in the :term:`Coverage Zone File`, or when the client can be determined to be from the United States of America

:initialDispersion:  The number of :term:`cache server`\ s between which traffic requesting the same object will be randomly split - meaning that if 4 clients all request the same object (one after another), then if this is above 4 there is a possibility that all 4 are cache misses. For most use-cases, this should be 1\ [1]_
:ipv6RoutingEnabled: If ``true``, clients that connect to Traffic Router using IPv6 will be given the IPv6 address of a suitable Edge-tier :term:`cache server`; if ``false`` all addresses will be IPv4, regardless of the client connection\ [1]_

		HEADER_REGEXP
			Use the :term:`Delivery Service` if ``pattern`` matches an HTTP header (both the name and value) in an HTTP request\ [1]_
		PATH_REGEXP
			Use the :term:`Delivery Service` if ``pattern`` matches the request path of this :term:`Delivery Service`'s URL
		STEERING_REGEXP
			Use the :term:`Delivery Service` if ``pattern`` matches the ``xml_id`` of one of this :term:`Delivery Service`'s "Steering" target :term:`Delivery Service`\ s

:maxDnsAnswers:    The maximum number of IPs to put in responses to A/AAAA DNS record requests (0 means all available)\ [3]_
:midHeaderRewrite: Rewrite operations to be performed on TCP headers at the Edge-tier cache level - used by the Header Rewrite :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` plugin
:missLat:          The latitude to use when the client cannot be found in the :term:`Coverage Zone File` or a geographic IP lookup
:missLong:         The longitude to use when the client cannot be found in the :term:`Coverage Zone File` or a geographic IP lookup

:orgServerFqdn:    The URL of the :term:`Delivery Service`'s origin server for use in retrieving content from the :term:`origin server`

	.. note:: Despite the field name, this must truly be a full URL - including the protocol (e.g. ``http://`` or ``https://``) - **NOT** merely the server's :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`

:originShield:       An "origin shield" is a forward proxy that sits between Mid-tier :term:`cache server`\ s and the :term:`origin` and performs further caching beyond what's offered by a standard CDN. This field is a string of :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`\ s to use as origin shields, delimited by ``|``
:profileDescription: The description of the Traffic Router :term:`Profile` with which this :term:`Delivery Service` is associated
:profileId:          The integral, unique identifier for the Traffic Router :term:`Profile` with which this :term:`Delivery Service` is associated

	0
		HTTP
	1
		HTTPS
	2
		Both HTTP and HTTPS

:qstringIgnore: Tells :term:`cache server`\ s whether or not to consider URLs with different query parameter strings to be distinct - this is an integer on the interval [0-2] where the values have these meanings:

	0
		URLs with different query parameter strings will be considered distinct for caching purposes, and query strings will be passed upstream to the :term:`origin`
	1
		URLs with different query parameter strings will be considered identical for caching purposes, and query strings will be passed upstream to the :term:`origin`
	2
		Query strings are stripped out by Edge-tier :term:`cache server`\ s, and thus are neither taken into consideration for caching purposes, nor passed upstream in requests to the :term:`origin`

:rangeRequestHandling: Tells caches how to handle range requests\ [4]_ - this is an integer on the interval [0,2] where the values have these meanings:

	0
		Range requests will not be cached, but range requests that request ranges of content already cached will be served from the :term:`cache server`
	1
		Use the `background_fetch plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/plugins/background_fetch.en.html>`_ to service the range request while caching the whole object
	2
		Use the `experimental cache_range_requests plugin <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/master/plugins/experimental/cache_range_requests>`_ to treat unique ranges as unique objects

:regexRemap: A regular expression "remap rule" to apply to this :term:`Delivery Service` at the Edge tier

	.. seealso:: `The Apache Trafficserver documentation for the Regex Remap plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/plugins/regex_remap.en.html>`_

:signed:           ``true`` if token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`, ``false`` otherwise
:signingAlgorithm: Type of URL signing method to sign the URLs, basically comes down to one of two plugins or ``null``:

	``null``
		Token-based authentication is not enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`
	url_sig:
		URL Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`
	uri_signing
		URI Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`

	.. seealso:: `The Apache Trafficserver documentation for the url_sig plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/8.0.x/admin-guide/plugins/url_sig.en.html>`_ and `the draft RFC for uri_signing <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-uri-signing-16>`_ - note, however that the current implementation of uri_signing uses Draft 12 of that RFC document, **NOT** the latest

:sslKeyVersion: This integer indicates the generation of keys in use by the :term:`Delivery Service` - if any - and is incremented by the Traffic Portal client whenever new keys are generated

	.. warning:: This number will not be correct if keys are manually replaced using the API, as the key generation API does not increment it!

:tenantId:          The integral, unique identifier of the :term:`Tenant` who owns this :term:`Delivery Service`
:trRequestHeaders:  If defined, this takes the form of a string of HTTP headers to be included in Traffic Router access logs for requests - it's a template where ``__RETURN__`` translates to a carriage return and line feed (``\r\n``)\ [1]_
:trResponseHeaders: If defined, this takes the form of a string of HTTP headers to be included in Traffic Router responses - it's a template where ``__RETURN__`` translates to a carriage return and line feed (``\r\n``)\ [1]_
:type:              The name of the routing type of this :term:`Delivery Service` e.g. "HTTP"
:typeId:            The integral, unique identifier of the routing type of this :term:`Delivery Service`
:xmlId:             A unique string that describes this :term:`Delivery Service` - exists for legacy reasons, but is used heavily by Traffic Control components
