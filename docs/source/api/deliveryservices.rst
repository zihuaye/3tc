	url_sig:
		URL Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`
	uri_signing
		URI Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`

	.. seealso:: `The Apache Trafficserver documentation for the url_sig plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/8.0.x/admin-guide/plugins/url_sig.en.html>`_ and `the draft RFC for uri_signing <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-uri-signing-16>`_ - note, however that the current implementation of uri_signing uses Draft 12 of that RFC document, **NOT** the latest

:sslKeyVersion: This integer indicates the generation of keys in use by the :term:`Delivery Service` - if any - and is incremented by the Traffic Portal client whenever new keys are generated

	.. warning:: This number will not be correct if keys are manually replaced using the API, as the key generation API does not increment it!

		URLs with different query parameter strings will be considered identical for caching purposes, and query strings will be passed upstream to the origin
	2
		Query strings are stripped out by Edge-tier caches, and thus are neither taken into consideration for caching purposes, nor passed upstream in requests to the origin

:rangeRequestHandling: Tells caches how to handle range requests\ [7]_ - this is an integer on the interval [0,2] where the values have these meanings:

	0
		Range requests will not be cached, but range requests that request ranges of content already cached will be served from the cache
	1
		Use the `background_fetch plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/plugins/background_fetch.en.html>`_ to service the range request while caching the whole object
	2
		Use the `experimental cache_range_requests plugin <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/master/plugins/experimental/cache_range_requests>`_ to treat unique ranges as unique objects
