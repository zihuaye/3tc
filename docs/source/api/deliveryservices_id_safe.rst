:initialDispersion:  The number of caches between which traffic requesting the same object will be randomly split - meaning that if 4 clients all request the same object (one after another), then if this is above 4 there is a possibility that all 4 are cache misses. For most use-cases, this should be 1
:ipv6RoutingEnabled: If ``true``, clients that connect to Traffic Router using IPv6 will be given the IPv6 address of a suitable Edge-tier cache; if ``false`` all addresses will be IPv4, regardless of the client connection\ [2]_
:lastUpdated:        The date and time at which this :term:`Delivery Service` was last updated, in a ``ctime``-like format

		PATH_REGEXP
			Use the :term:`Delivery Service` if ``pattern`` matches the request path of this :term:`Delivery Service`'s URL
		STEERING_REGEXP
			Use the :term:`Delivery Service` if ``pattern`` matches the ``xml_id`` of one of this :term:`Delivery Service`'s "Steering" target :term:`Delivery Service`\ s

:maxDnsAnswers:      The maximum number of IPs to put in a A/AAAA response for a DNS :term:`Delivery Service` (0 means all available)\ [4]_

		HTTP
	1
		HTTPS
	2
		Both HTTP and HTTPS

:qstringIgnore: Tells caches whether or not to consider URLs with different query parameter strings to be distinct - this is an integer on the interval [0-2] where the values have these meanings:

	0
		URLs with different query parameter strings will be considered distinct for caching purposes, and query strings will be passed upstream to the origin
	1
		URLs with different query parameter strings will be considered identical for caching purposes, and query strings will be passed upstream to the origin
	2
		Query strings are stripped out by Edge-tier caches, and thus are neither taken into consideration for caching purposes, nor passed upstream in requests to the origin

	0
		Range requests will not be cached, but range requests that request ranges of content already cached will be served from the cache

	2
		Use the `experimental cache_range_requests plugin <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/master/plugins/experimental/cache_range_requests>`_ to treat unique ranges as unique objects

:regexRemap: A regular expression remap rule to apply to this :term:`Delivery Service` at the Edge tier

	.. seealso:: `The Apache Trafficserver documentation for the Regex Remap plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/plugins/regex_remap.en.html>`_

:signed:           ``true`` if token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`, ``false`` otherwise
:signingAlgorithm: Type of URL signing method to sign the URLs, basically comes down to one of two plugins or ``null``:

	``null``
		Token-based authentication is not enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`
	url_sig:
		URL Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`
	uri_signing
		URI Signing token-based authentication is enabled for this :term:`Delivery Service`

	.. seealso:: `The Apache Trafficserver documentation for the url_sig plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/8.0.x/admin-guide/plugins/url_sig.en.html>`_ and `the draft RFC for uri_signing <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-uri-signing-16>`_ - note, however that the current implementation of uri_signing uses Draft 12 of that RFC document, NOT the latest.

	.. versionadded:: 1.3

:sslKeyVersion:       This integer indicates the generation of keys in use by the :term:`Delivery Service` - if any - and is incremented by the Traffic Portal client whenever new keys are generated

	.. warning:: This number will not be correct if keys are manually replaced using the API, as the key generation API does not increment it!

	.. versionadded:: 1.3

:tenantId:            The integral, unique identifier of the tenant who owns this :term:`Delivery Service`

:trResponseHeaders:   If defined, this takes the form of a string of HTTP headers to be included in Traffic Router responses - it's a template where ``__RETURN__`` translates to a carriage return and line feed (``\r\n``)\ [2]_
:type:                The name of the routing type of this :term:`Delivery Service` e.g. "HTTP"
:typeId:              The integral, unique identifier of the routing type of this :term:`Delivery Service`
