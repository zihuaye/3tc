# To use this compose you should first build Traffic Ops and then copy the RPM to :
#
# trafficcontrol/infrastructure/cdn-in-a-box/traffic_ops/traffic_ops.rpm
#
#      cd trafficcontrol/infrastructure/cdn-in-a-box
#
# Adjust the settings in `variables.env` to suit your needs.
#
#      docker-compose up -d
#
# The Traffic Ops Go API will then be available on https://localhost:6443,
# the Perl API on https://localhost:60443, and the postgres database on localhost 5432.
#
# Note that this setup is intended for testing and not for production use.
