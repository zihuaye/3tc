Versioning
==========
The :mod:`trafficops.__version__` module contains only the :data:`__version__` "constant" which
gives the version of this *Apache-TrafficControl package* and **not** the version of
*Apache Traffic Control* for which it was made. The two are versioned separately, to allow the
client to grow in a version-controlled manner without being tied to the release cadence of Apache
Traffic Control as a whole.

Version 1.0 is supported for use with Apache Traffic Control version 3.0 (release pending at the
time of this writing). New functionality will be added as the :ref:`to-api` evolves, but changes to
this client will remain non-breaking for existing code using it until the next major version is
released.

.. deprecated:: 1.0
	The v1.0 release of this client deprecates support of Python2. Versions 2.0 and onward will
	*only* support Python3 (v3.4+). Note that this release is expected either by the time Python2
	reaches its end-of-life at the end of 2019, or with the release of Apache Traffic Control v4.0,
	should that happen first. Users and developers are encouraged to switch to Python3 as soon as
	possible.
